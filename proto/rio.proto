/*
  This is the interface for the "RIO" service, which provides functionality for estimating the uncertainty in the
  predictor's predictions, as well as providing corrected predictions.

  The predictor could be a neural network or other models capable of generating predictions based on inputs.

  For more information see the white paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00588

  All data passed to RIO-service requests ("normed_train_data", "train_labels", "train_predictions",  normed_test_data,
  and "test_predictions") should be in CSV format.
